# Software Product requirements:
The product should be able to generate probabilistic nomograms. 
This is extending on traditional nomograms that rely on fixed value inputs to proide fixed outputs. 
Instead a distribution of inputs will be provided, potentially for more than 1 of the inputs.
Maximum complexity of 3 input variables (?).
As a result, a distribution of outputs will be output.

The statistical distribution of the input should be easily adjustable by the client (User 2) by graphical means (clicking, sliding etc), and not, for example, by explicitly typing in the standard deviation or the mean of input distributions.
The input method for the client should be easy and intuitive, and this should be evaluated with usability studies later on.

## User story 1 (e.g. nurse/vendor):
As a vendor I want to be able to provide an equation to the software, and the appropriate nomogram to be output graphically.

## User story 2(e.g. patient, client):
As a client, I want to be able to view a generated nomogram, and GRAPHICALLY (clicking, sliding etc) adjust the distribution of the input variables to view a distribution of outputs. 

## Minimum Viable Product requirements:
Above functonality but for a fixed monogram equation/ simple 2 variable equations (e.g. A = B+C). 
Support adjusting the distribution of one variable.
